## Jersey City citibike Usage Patterns 2019-2020


 Using [**citibike System Data**](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) I have visually documented the effects of the Covid 19 shutdown on the usage of citibikes in Jersey City.

 It is easy to see how citibike usage changed year over year.  Grove St Path had 6,892 riders in 2019 vs 2,259 riders start in 2020.  That trend while trying to recover during the summer months could not make up the volumes that the ridership saw in 2019.

 2020 saw a large increase in the number of non-member riders taking to the streets while ride subscriptions plunged markedly first during the shutdown from late February into early June.  Covid hit overall volume usage for the 2020 year.
